      From volcanoes of millenia bygone, to extensions of the Himalayan
      Foothills, and Limestone peaks carved out by the valleys, canyons, and
      caves below, the North of Thailand is a mountaineer's paradise. With it's
      diverse landscapes however, every nature lover is sure to find their
      <i>raison d'etre.</i> Tree huggers will appreciate the lush jungles &
      forests that cover a quarter of the entire country (and are also the
      oldest evergreen rainforests in the world), the coastline protecting
      mangroves, and the 200 different floral species per hectare making this
      one of the most bio-diverse plant areas on the planet. Birdwatchers will
      glee trying to spot the multiple endagered species hosted here from a
      collection of nearly 1000 native & migratory bird species, including birds
      of prey. Cold blooded enthusiasts can enjoy being slithered on by the
      nearly 200 species of snakes which include Cobras, Pythons, and Vipers.
      Other reptiles include amphibious tortoises (like the Asian Giant Tortoise
      which can live over a 100 years), and over 300 lizard species. Fellow warm
      blooded lovers will appreciate the nearly 300 species of mammals here
      which make up 10% of the world's animals. Theres everything from majestic
      elephants, to fierce tigers. Playful primates like monkeys, Gibbons, and
      Macaques. Exotic animals you've never head of like Sun Bears & Sambars.
      And even edible animals! Like deer & wild hog for the avid hunter.

    <p class="paragraph">
      From colourful Tom Yum soups to colourful Ladyboys, Thailand's cities
      offer spicy cuisines for the bold of heart. Thai ciusine is world famous
      for it's spicy, tangy, sweet, and bold flavours that derive their taste
      directly from herbs & aromatic leaves as opposed to traditionally used
      spices. Fun fact - the bold flavored drink Red Bull was actually invented
      in Thailand. Thai cities also offer live entertainment from feirce Muay
      Thai fights to red light district Ping Pong shows both of which originated
      in Thailand, and show the vigour of humans pushing their physical limits.
      Being in a populous dense area such as the city can be particularly fun
      during three Thai festivals that are so popular, they are internationally
      known. Full Moon Party is the wildest rave around, the Lantern Festival
      lights up the entire sky with specks of light, and Songkran (Water
      Festival) turns the entire country into a water fight battleground for 3
      whole days! Cities also offer fun activities like sightseeing tours,
      traitional Thai cooking classes, and Eco Tourism featuring a range of eco
      friendly activities unique to the area like learning how to build houses
      from natural materials like clay & bamboo. On the outskirts of Thai cities
      exist many ancient temples dating back to the 11th century. Designed with
      stunning & intricate Buddhist architecture, with a touch of Hindu
      influence, these structures will satiate the palate of the Renaissance Man
      seeking history, art, culture, and architecture.
