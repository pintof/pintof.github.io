      Thailand boasting it's 2,130 KM<sup>2</sup> of coral reefs is teaming with
      life beneath it's seas. It is truly another world down there, for the
      willing diver to explore. This world is inhabited by a vast range of
      diverse species. Giant migratory marine species like manta rays, whales,
      and whale sharks. Intricately patterned, colourful creatures called
      Nudibranchs that are small as a fingernail. Octopus & cuttlefish that not
      only look out of this world, but also have matching alien like abilities
      such as colour changing and light emitting. And gender progressive
      critters such as Clownfish who can change their gender, and Seahorses
      where the male takes up the mantle of childbirth.

      Thailand lies smack dab in the middle of two oceans, it's east coast on
      the Gulf of Thailand is part of the largest Ocean - The Pacific, and it's
      west coast on the Andaman Sea is part of the smallest Ocean - The Indian.
      This coastal country offers the seafarer over 500 islands to sail and
      explore, all being of world class tropical beauty, so much so that it is
      often featured in Hollywood movies such as 'The Beach' ft. Leonardo
      DiCaprio. In addition to it's picturesque beauty, the islands also have
      various species of animals to observe, and sometimes even interact with
      such as monkeys, monitors, giant snakes, tropical birds, and even tropical
      girls! The Islands also boast eco-tourism, wild full moon parties, and top
      notch rock climbing via it's limestone cliffs.
