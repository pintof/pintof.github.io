1. Do all the current ammendmants & map overlays indicate that the current CLUPA map app does not show the most current information?

2. Does the tag <OVERLAY_IND> mean that this layer is overlapped with another layer, so the land use policy for this layer may not be accurate?
And is this irrelevant as your API pulls the ID of the top most layer when a point is queried?

3. If <PARK_ADMIN_ZONE_NAME> is not blank, does this mean MECP is the custodian of this land, and if the tag is blank does this mean MNR is the custodian?

4. is EFFECTIVE_DATETIME the same as 'Date Policy Report Last Updated'? 
What datetime format is EFFECTIVE_DATETIME in?
